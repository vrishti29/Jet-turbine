# Jet-turbine

Being a mechanical student at IGDTUW, due to the unavailability of the turbine lab i wasn’t able to learn about the parts of the turbine by looking at each one of them closely and see how they work. I didn’t want that for my juniors, hence I designed this JET TURBINE STIMULATION.
This JET TURBINE STIMULATION shows the working of all the parts of the turbine. In a real turbine as well, the working of internal parts can not be seen as it is covered with Hull. To look at the internal components well, we have to remove the hull or dismantle specific components, which may result in improper function. But in this stimulation, you can see how would the turbine works with and without certain components.
For example, if we remove the hull, we will be able to see all the moving parts inside the turbine. We can switch on and off the fan of the turbine. we can also see how the entire structure will be working if we move the pistons.
This stimulation can be really helpful in a complete and proper understanding of the working of a jet turbine.
